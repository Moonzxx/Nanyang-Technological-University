
    VrmlPad 2.1
    ~~~~~~~~~~~

    VrmlPad is a powerful and flexible authoring tool from ParallelGraphics
    that allows you to design and develop professional VRML content.
    Use VrmlPad to create VRML worlds for publishing on the World Wide Web.
    VrmlPad fully supports the VRML 97 specification.

    What's New
    ~~~~~~~~~~

    + Working with workspace

    Now you can save the current VrmlPad workspace, including the placement
    of all open files, their caret positions, bookmarks, fold settings and
    debug breakpoints. Choose File > Workspace > Save and specify the name
    for the workspace to be saved. The latest saved workspace will be opened
    automatically when you restart VrmlPad. To use a different workspace,
    choose it in the Open Workspace dialog (File > Workspace > Open),
    workspace files have the .vws extension.

    + Preview individual nodes

    In addition to previewing a whole scene, now you can preview any individual
    node in it. This node (as well as its descendant nodes, if any) will be
    opened in a default VRML-viewer. To preview a node, position the caret
    inside the text of the node and choose Node Preview command from Tools menu.

    + Node thumbnails

    Node thumbnails are small rendered pictures of individual nodes in the scene.
    These pictures appear to the right of the Text editor as soon you type in
    the text of the corresponding nodes.
    To enable node thumbnails, choose Options from Tools menu, click Editor tab
    to open the corresponding page, and select Render node thumbnails.

    Dynamic errors detecting - View and enumerate syntax and wide range of
                               semantic errors and warnings – undefined
                               identifiers, nonmatched fields, duplicated
                               node definitions and more.

    Scene Tree - View, edit and navigate hierarchical scene structure.
                 Synchronize selection in both directions. Delete, comment
                 and rename nodes, PROTOs and field declarations.

    Resource View - View, edit and navigate document dependencies. Rename
                    and browse all references to a resource. Convert, when
                    possible, absolute references to relative and vice versa.

    Routing Map - Browse and edit connections between events and exposed fields
                  in your scene (routes). 

    Preview - Preview scenes in various installed browsers and VRML-viewers.
              Preview individual nodes using the Node Preview command.

    Elimination of unused identifiers - Seek and delete redundant field 
                                        definitions and routes in your scenes.

    VRML extension node libraries - Utilize the latest VRML extension nodes from
                                    Web3D consortium, ParallelGraphics, Blaxxun, 
                                    GeoVRML, etc. VrmlPad supports semantic and

                                    declarations for this nodes. The list of node 
                                    libraries can be updated online. Use your own 
                                    custom set of extension nodes.

    Automation and Scripting - Manipulate the program from external
                               applications using the C, C++, Visual Basic(R),
                               Borland Delphi(R). Create add-ins, VBScript and
                               JavaScript macros and execute them from within
                               the VrmlPad environment, automating custom tasks.
